This platform is designed to facilitate connections between the ITK career center, students, and employers. It aims to streamline the process of finding job opportunities, internships, and career development resources.

Tech Stack:

Features:
Login & Authentication: Includes secure login, password reset, email verification, and Google Sign-In functionality.
User Dashboard: Allows users to manage their certificates, work experience, and educational background, as well as schedule counseling appointments and upload their resumes.
